X-Xss-Protection headers stop browsers from loading when they detect xss.



0 
  Disables XSS filtering.
1
    Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts).
1; mode=block
    Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected.
1; report=<reporting-URI> (Chromium only)
    Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report.
