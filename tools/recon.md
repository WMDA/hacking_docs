## Maletgo 

Graphs and mind maps OSINT. Each block on a Maltego graph is an entity which has values attached to it to describe it. In Maltegoâ€™s terminology, a transform is a piece of code that would query an API to retrieve information related to a specific entity. Information related to an entity goes via a transform to return zero or more entities. *WARNING* Maltego may directly connect to target host so be careful.

An example we have a hostname google.com. We can use an enity to transform this into an IP address. This then creates a mind map, and we can do more and more transformations. All information gathered (including names and email addresses) are presented in a mind map. *NOT ALL TRANSFORMS ARE FREE*
